# Open Package Project

Open Package is an open-source project to develop a platform independant packaging and deployment tool.

It is similar to rpm or Debian packaging, but, not tied to any specific Operating System or development environments like npm or J2EE.

## Basic Features 

Using Open Package tool a package can be created using the following command:

```$ opkg create --pkg=myapp```

The above command will create a tarball myapp.tgz based on the meta-data defined in myapp.yml. In myapp.yml, you can specify the content of myapp.tgz, and, how myapp is installed on a target host.

A package is installed on the local system as in the following example:

```$ opkg install --pkg=/path/to/myapp.tgz```

When installing a package the following syntax can be used as well:

```$ opkg install --pkg=myapp```

In the above case, package tool will try to download myapp.tgz from a remote repository or shared drive based on the local repository configuration. We will see how a repository can be setup for maintaining opkg packages, in the latter sections.

## Package Manifest

Following is a sample package manifest with all the supported options used:

```
#Sample opkg manifest file 
--- 

#Core Configs 
name: myapp
rel_num: 1.2.3

depends:
 - baseapp 
#- coreapp LATEST
#- another_app 1.0.0

conflicts:
 - badapp 

#Package Content
files:
   - greeting/hi.txt: hi.txt
   - apps: src/archives

#OPKG defined vars: OPKG_NAME, OPKG_REL_NUM, OPKG_ACTION
vars:
   - MYAPP_ENV1: "sample env"
   - DB_NAME: myapp_db
   - DC_NAME: "{{ DC_NAME }}"

#Deployment Playbook
pre_deploy:
 - echo Going to deploy {{ OPKG_NAME }} v{{ OPKG_REL_NUM }}
 - mkdir -p /etc/myapp

#target_path: source_path
#target path is relative to OPKG_DEPLOY_DIR
#source paths is relative to OPKG_STAGE_DIR
targets:
   - apps: apps
   - greeting: greeting

#The target paths are relative to OPKG_DEPLOY_DIR unless absolute path is specified.
templates:
   - greeting/hi.txt

#The target paths are relative to OPKG_DEPLOY_DIR unless absolute path is specified.
replaces:
   apps/conf/server.conf:
      - HTTP_PORT=80: HTTP_PORT=9090

#The target paths are relative to OPKG_DEPLOY_DIR unless absolute path is specified.
symlinks:
   - /etc/myapp/apps: apps

#The target paths are relative to OPKG_DEPLOY_DIR unless absolute path is specified.
#Format: PATH: chown_input chmod_input
permissions:
   - apps: root:root 0444

#Paths have to be fully qualified with OPKG_INSTALL_ROOT, OPKG_DEPLOY_DIR etc, if needed.
post_deploy:
   - cat {{ OPKG_DEPLOY_DIR }}/greeting/hi.txt

rollback:

#Run-time
#Scripts or bash commands can be specified as a steps for following runtime
#actions, start, stop  and rollback. restart will run both stop and start in succession.
#Fully qualify scripts with OPKG_INSTALL_ROOT, OPKG_DEPLOY_DIR etc if needed.
